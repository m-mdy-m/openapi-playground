## Unveiling the `info` Object

The `info` object within your OpenAPI Specification acts as the central hub for essential metadata about your API. It provides a clear and concise overview, allowing users and developers to understand your API's purpose, functionalities, and contact details. Here's a breakdown of each property within the `info` object:

**Required Properties:**

* **title (string):**  This is the centerpiece of your `info` object.  Consider it your API's name tag. Choose a clear and concise title that accurately reflects your API's functionality. 
* **version (string):**  Here's where you define the version of your API. This versioning helps users track changes and identify the specific API version they're interacting with. It can be a simple version number (e.g., "1.0.0") or a more descriptive string (e.g., "beta").

**Optional Properties:**

* **summary (string):**  Provide a brief yet informative summary of your API. This short description should highlight the core functionalities your API offers.
* **description (string):**  For those who crave more details, the `description` property allows you to elaborate on your API's purpose and functionalities. Here, you can provide a comprehensive overview, including use cases and target audience. You can even leverage Markdown formatting to enhance readability.
* **termsOfService (string URL):**  If your API has specific terms of service that users must agree to before using it, this is where you'd specify the URL to those terms. 
* **contact (object):**  Sometimes, users may need to reach out for support or clarification. The `contact` object allows you to provide contact information, including:
    * **name (string):**  The name of the contact person or organization.
    * **url (string URL):**  A URL linking to a contact page or support documentation.
    * **email (string email):**  An email address for users to reach out for support.
* **license (object):**  Is your API licensed under a specific open-source license? If so, you can specify the license information here. The `license` object can have two properties:
    * **name (string):**  The name of the license (e.g., "Apache 2.0").
    * **url (string URL):**  A URL linking to the full license text.
