## Unveiling the `tags` Object: Categorizing Your API Operations

The `tags` object within your OpenAPI Specification provides a way to categorize and group related operations in your API. This functionality plays a significant role in enhancing the usability and discoverability of your API documentation. Here's a breakdown of how tags work:

**Structure:**

There are two primary locations for defining tags within your OpenAPI Specification:

1. **Global Tags:**  These tags are defined at the root level of your OpenAPI document, outside of the `paths` object. They represent broad categories applicable to multiple operations across your API.
2. **Operation-Level Tags:**  These tags are defined within individual operation objects within the `paths` object. They allow you to assign more specific tags to operations based on their functionality.

**Properties:**

Each tag, whether defined globally or at the operation level, can have the following properties:

* **name (string):**  The unique name of the tag.

**Optional Properties:**

* **description (string):**  A brief description of the tag, providing context for its purpose.
* **externalDocs (object):**  (Optional) An object linking to external documentation relevant to the tag. It can have two properties:
    * **url (string URL):** The URL of the external documentation.
    * **description (string):** A description of the external documentation.

**Benefits of Tags:**

* **Improved Documentation:**  Tags help to organize your API documentation, making it easier for users to find relevant functionalities. Tools like Swagger UI often use tags to group operations within the user interface.
* **Enhanced Code Generation:**  Some code generation tools can leverage tags to generate code that is more organized and reflects the API's structure.
* **Custom Filtering:**  Tools might allow users to filter displayed operations based on specific tags, aiding in targeted exploration of the API.

**Example:**

Here's an example showcasing both global tags and operation-level tags:

```yaml
# Global Tags (optional)
tags:
  - name: products
    description: Operations related to product management
  - name: users
    description: Operations related to user accounts

paths:
  /products:  # Endpoint for products
    get:
      summary: Get all products
      description: Returns a list of all products in the store.
      tags:  # Operation-level tags
        - products
    post:
      summary: Create a new product
      description: Creates a new product in the store.
      tags:
        - products

  /users:  # Endpoint for users
    get:
      summary: Get all users
      description: Returns a list of all users in the system.
      tags:
        - users
```

**Explanation:**

* We've defined two global tags: `products` and `users`.
* The `/products` endpoint has both a GET and POST operation, and both are tagged with `"products"`.
* The `/users` endpoint's GET operation is tagged with `"users"`.
